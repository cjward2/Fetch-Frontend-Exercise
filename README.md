Frontend Take-Home Exercise
This is the frontend exercise for Fetch. In this project, I decided to go with a dog newsletter theme. The form has full validation managed via state in React, and features interactive messages for the user. I also added some styling that I thought brought a nice UI/UX feel to the project.
